      <description>For a long time this website has had a couple of links to contact me, but those days are over.
Now I have a brand new Hugo website with a custom written theme complete with
 A homepage with more social links, and description of my skills An about page with description of who I am A blog  Why Hugo? The first question is why a site builder? I&amp;rsquo;m competent at web development, why not just write it all myself?</description>
